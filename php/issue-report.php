        <p>Energy consumption and generation are two pivotal challenges that have continually confronted Caribbean nations. The effects of these 
        challenges are evident in the increasing cost for oil as well as domestic electricity rates in Caribbean countries. It is for these reasons 
        and more why there is an overwhelming necessity for the transition away from fossil fuels and towards the realm of sustainable energy.
        However, there are a few issues that hinder the transition towards renewables in many CARICOM member states.
        One of the issues CARICOM member states face that hinder their transition to renewables is the uncertainty in the 
        energy prices, as such projections are coherent regarding the oil and gas industry prices. As most of the costs for renewable energy are from 
        the upfront expenses of building and installing solar and wind farms; questions about if the investment was worth it would have been raised. 
        In 2017 the average cost to install solar systems was $2000 per kilowatt compared to $1000 per kilowatt for a new natural gas plant. This 
        higher construction cost would make financial institutions perceive renewable energy as a risky investment compared to the coherent and stable 
        cost of gas and oil with a lower construction cost for a power plant. One way of combating the issue of high installation prices for renewables 
        is by using a method known as energy auctions. This is where countries ask for competitive bids for large-scale energy contracts (power plants).
        The country then chooses the energy project developer with a contract that offers the lowest possible price.<br><br></p>
